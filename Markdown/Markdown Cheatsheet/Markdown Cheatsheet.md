# Headings
Headings start with a hash (#) symbol.  Place 1 - 6 hashes in front of some text to make it a heading.

# Bold & Italic Text
Text with **two asterisks** or __two underscores__ are bolded.  Text with a *single asterisk* or _underscore_ are italic.

# Links & Image Links
Links are square brackets next to parenthesis.  Square brackets hold the text you want to show, parenthesis holds the link.

Image links are just links with an exclaimation mark in front of it.
