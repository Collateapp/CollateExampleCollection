<p>Alice in Wonderland</p><p><br></p><p><img src="collection:///Rich-Text/Rich%20Text%20Formatting/attachments/Alice_par_John_Tenniel_30.png"></p><p><strong>Alice</strong> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her</p><p>sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p><p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or</p><p>conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice,</p><p>"without pictures or conversations?"</p><p><br></p><p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the</p><p>hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of</p><p>making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and</p><p>picking the daisies, when suddenly a <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">White</span> Rabbit with <span style="color: rgb(250, 204, 204);">pink</span> eyes ran</p><p>close by her.</p><p><br></p><p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it</p><p>so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh</p><p>dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it over</p><p>afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,</p><p>but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit</p><p>actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it,</p><p>and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across</p><p>her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a</p><p>waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with</p><p>curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to</p><p>see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p><p><br></p><p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how</p><p>in the world she was to get out again.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then</p><p>dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think</p><p>about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed</p><p>to be a <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">very deep well</span>.
